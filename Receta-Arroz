<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup rice</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup angel hair pasta (Capellini)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Ground garlic to taste</li>
    <li>Diced green onion to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a strainer, wash the rice</li>
    <li>To a pan or pot, in medium heat, add the oil and the pasta. Allow it to cook until tan/brown. Mix ocationally to prevent uneven cooking/burning</li>
    <li>Add onions and allow to cook until fragant</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and allow to cook until fragant</li>
    <li>Add the washed rice and mix. Allow the rice to cook in this mix for about a minute</li>
    <li>Add the water, followed by the salt</li>
    <li>Bring to boil and allow the water to evaporate until you see little holes forming on the surface of the rice</li>
    <li>Cover with a lid and set the heat to low</li>
    <li>Allow rice to cook covered for 10 min</li>
    <li>Taste to determine if more cooking time is needed. If so, cover and cook for another 5 min</li>
    <li>After the rice is done, remove the lid to prevent the rice from absorbing too much water and becoming lumpy</li>
  </ol>
